## Hey, I'm Ava 👋

Recent CS grad from Virginia Tech. Got into cybersecurity after taking a cyberwarfare class in Running Start.

### What I'm up to
- Studying for Security+ cert

### Projects I've built
- **[Security Log Analyzer](https://avar777.github.io/Security-Log-Analyzer/)** - Detects attack patterns like SQL injection and brute force attempts. Built this to practice log analysis skills that security analysts use.
- **[Cailly](https://calily-api.vercel.app/)** - AI-powered health tracker I built for people with autoimmune conditions. Full-stack with Node.js, React, MongoDB.
- **[Lately](https://lately.avaraper.com)** - Serverless photo journal built on AWS (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, CloudFront). Personal Instagram alternative where I'm the only uploader, but anyone can view, like, and comment. Built this to learn cloud architecture and AWS services.
